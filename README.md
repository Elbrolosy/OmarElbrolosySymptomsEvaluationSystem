# OmarElbrolosySymptomsEvaluationSystem
* Master is my first submission which contains some issues like :
  * No space between the number and Game in "Symptom #1Game"
  * First game overall rating gets calculated based on the severity score only
  * Overall rating in general gets calculated using the severity score not the severity score difference (Not sure what to use)
* severity-score branch :
  * Bugs in the first version is resolved
  * The overall rating still calculated using severity score but the first game gives none overall rating.
* severity-diff branch :
  * Just like severity-score branch but the overall rating equations is calculated based on the severity difference between last and previous games
